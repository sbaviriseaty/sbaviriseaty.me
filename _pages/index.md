# Hello! I'm Sruthika. 🌱

I'm a biomedical engineering student at the University of Florida, and I'm interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence in healthcare. 
As I get a better grasp of how AI technology can be applied to personalized medicine or diagnosis processes, I also want to learn about the ethical concerns of its application. 

This website will serve as a glimpse into my mind as I explore the applications and implications of AI in healthcare, while also exploring the practice of digital gardening. The notes I write here are setting the roots for topics I want to better understand or techniques I want to further employ in my lifetime.

  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[[Your first note|my first note]]</span> to enter my garden!
</p>

In addition to learning about journaling, here's what I've been up to. 
1. Nurturing my long-abandoned affinity toward Hans Zimmer soundtracks by finally learning piano
2. Getting the hang of vector art, namely the pencil tool, in Affinity Designer
3. Developing better closure with my culture by reading works by Indian-American authors
